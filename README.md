## Overview
The project is an attempt to learn unsupervised learning, deep learning, and NLP to implement a music recommendation system with Spotify application. 
After cleaning the data, we used k-mean clustering for data visualization, one-hot encoding, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency to calculate the most prominent genre in each song and their prevalent across songs to determine the weight of the genre.

## Result
We could not find a way to test because of some user data confidentiality from Spotify, but we have been able to analyzed user listening data, and have an idea for future project to implement the algorithm and test our theory.
